# CV
## Francesco Nunez Alessi
Born in Rome and shipped to the UK and then back a bit to Belgium where I finished school. A clueless me decided to make a return back to the UK to study graphic design. Graduated, I started as a freelancer while trying to get a full-time job. In the meantime I worked in a factory, enjoyed that more than freelancing as a graphic designer and thought it was time to move on...

Saving money was worth it, did a full-time 3 month intensive web development course at Makers Academy and loved every minute of it. At first I didn't know anything about coding except that it existed. The most I ever thought about it was pondering over whether or not we could actually be in the Matrix.

Now I've made about 5 different web applications including a comic-strip builder and a social hub for developers on GitHub. Just like Neo I felt that I had woken up saying "I know how to code".

With new found love for coding I am now looking for a job as a junior developer.

### Skills

- Focused

I had no experience on wood-work and building instruments. Took me three weeks to build an electric guitar body out of Ikea side-tables. Which I assembled into one of my most prized possessions. I named it ["Trikea"](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31988285/Trikea-Old-IKEA-furniture-put-to-good-use).

- Resourceful

I've also produced a [photographic book](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32004029/Transiendence), created entirely from my own work. I taught myself how to [design in 3D](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32002401/3D-Modelling-With-Blender), play guitar and [produce music](https://soundcloud.com/temka1991).

- Analytical

If there's anything I've learnt at University, it's not to go head on into over-ambitious projects and work on too many things at once. Breaking things down into steps was the way that I managed to create my final major project in graphic design and all my projects at Makers Academy.

- Team player

Through-out the Makers Academy course I was working in pairs or in teams every day so communication and coordination was of utmost importance.

- Multi-lingual

Finished last 3 years of school in French, did an intensive summer course in Spanish and have family and friends in Italy.

- Troubleshooting and attention to detail

I have a good eye for spotting typos, or fragile code. My team mate from my last project still owes me the drink he promised for fixing his delete method and several other minor code breaking issues.

- Problem solving

I've always been the one for fixing things, not only when it comes to code, I've fixed a radiator, fixed the flush, fixed a shower head, fixed a laptop and much more.

- Creative

As a kid I built all kinds of Lego structures, made roman armour out of cardboard and played loads of construction video games which is what pushed me into the direction of graphic design. My major creative streak isn't artistically focused but more functionality focused. I love visualizing new, creative implementations. A clear and relevant example of how I use this skill would be [this diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8j1h64XKkhAdml1U0JsYWEzUE0/view?usp=sharing) which became the backbone of the AirBnB project.

### Hobbies

Although I've decided to stop my pursuit of a career in graphic design, that hasn't stopped from experimenting creatively, and most recently I've delved into 3D graphics. I've played guitar for 9 years. I love to produce my own music, inspired by the likes of Flying Lotus and many other artists across all genres. I also like to do some DIY because if I can make it myself, why buy it?
