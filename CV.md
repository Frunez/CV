# CV
## Francesco Nunez Alessi
Born in Rome and shipped to UK and then back a bit to Belgium where I finished
school and a clueless me decided to make a return back to the UK to study graphic
design. Graduated, I started as a freelancer while trying to get a get a
full-time job, in the meantime I worked in a factory, enjoyed that more than
graphic design and thought it was time to move on...

Saving money was worth it, did a full-time 3 month intensive web development
course at Makers Academy and loved every minute of it. At first I didn't know
anything about coding except that it existed and the most I ever thought about
it was pondering over whether or not we could actually be in the Matrix.

Now I've made about 5 different web applications including a comic-strip builder
and social hub for developers on GitHub. Just like Neo I felt that I had woken
up saying "I now know how to code".

With new found love for coding I am now looking for a job as a junior developer.

### Skills
- Troubleshooting and attention to detail

      We had two teams working on the final project at Makers Academy. The other team
      took two hours to solve a bug before calling me in to help, found the issue in
      five minutes. Just spotted that they used destroy instead of delete as a rails
      method.
- Team player

- Problem solving

- Focused

      I had no experience on wood-work and building instruments. took me three weeks
      to build a guitar body out of Ikea tables and assembly it into one of my most
      prized possessions.

- Creative/Idea generation

- Resourceful

      Apart from making a guitar with no previous experience, I've also produced a
      photographic book, created entirely from my own work. I taught myself how to
      design in 3D, play guitar and produce music.
- Analytical - breaking down problems

      If there's anything I've learnt at University, it's not to go head on into
      over-ambitious projects and work on too many things at once. Breaking
      things down into steps was the way that managed to create my final major
      projects in both graphic design and in Makers Academy.
- Integrity

- Perseverance

- Productive

### Hobbies

Although I've decided to stop my pursuit of a career in graphic design, that
hasn't stopped from experimenting creatively, and most recently I've delved into
3D graphics using Blender. I've played guitar for 9 years, and I love to produce
my own music, inspired by the likes of Flying Lotus and many other artists across
all genres. I also like to do some DIY because if I can make it myself, why buy
it?
