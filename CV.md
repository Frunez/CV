# CV
## Francesco Nunez Alessi
Born in Rome and shipped to the UK and then back a bit to Belgium where I finished school. A clueless me decided to make a return back to the UK to study graphic design. Graduated, I started as a freelancer while trying to get a full-time job, in the meantime I worked in a factory, enjoyed that more than graphic design and thought it was time to move on...

Saving money was worth it, did a full-time 3 month intensive web development course at Makers Academy and loved every minute of it. At first I didn't know anything about coding except that it existed. The most I ever thought about it was pondering over whether or not we could actually be in the Matrix.

Now I've made about 5 different web applications including a comic-strip builder and a social hub for developers on GitHub. Just like Neo I felt that I had woken up saying "I know how to code".

With new found love for coding I am now looking for a job as a junior developer.

### Skills

- Focused

I had no experience on wood-work and building instruments. Took me three weeks to build an electric guitar body out of Ikea side-tables. Which I assembled into one of my most prized possessions. I named it ["Trikea"](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31988285/Trikea-Old-IKEA-furniture-put-to-good-use).

- Resourceful

I've also produced a [photographic book](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32004029/Transiendence), created entirely from my own work. I taught myself how to [design in 3D](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32002401/3D-Modelling-With-Blender), play guitar and [produce music](https://soundcloud.com/temka1991).

- Analytical

If there's anything I've learnt at University, it's not to go head on into over-ambitious projects and work on too many things at once. Breaking things down into steps was the way that I managed to create my final major project in graphic design and all my projects at Makers Academy.

- Team player

Through-out the Makers Academy course I was constantly working in pairs or in teams so communication and coordination was of utmost importance.

- Multi-lingual

Finished last 3 years of school in French, did an intensive summer course in Spanish and have family and friends in Italy.

- Troubleshooting and attention to detail
- Problem solving
- Creative
- Productive

### Hobbies

Although I've decided to stop my pursuit of a career in graphic design, that hasn't stopped from experimenting creatively, and most recently I've delved into 3D graphics. I've played guitar for 9 years, and I love to produce my own music, inspired by the likes of Flying Lotus and many other artists across all genres. I also like to do some DIY because if I can make it myself, why buy it?
