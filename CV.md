# CV
## Francesco Nunez Alessi
Born in Rome, I grew up in the UK before heading to Belgium where I finished school. Unsure of what I wanted to do, I decided to return back to the UK to study Graphic Design. After graduating, I began my career as a freelancer whilst trying to get a full-time job. In the meantime I worked in a factory, where I found myself enjoying the work far more than freelancing as a graphic designer, and so I felt that it was time to move on...

From this, I did a full-time 3 month intensive web development course at Makers Academy and loved every minute of it. At first I didn't know anything about coding except that it existed. The most I ever thought about it, was pondering over whether or not we could actually be in the Matrix.

Now I've made about 5 different web applications including a comic-strip builder and a social hub for developers on GitHub. Just like Neo, I felt like I had woken up saying "I know how to code".

With my new found love of coding, I am now looking for a job as a junior developer.

### Skills

- Focused

I had no experience with wood work and building instruments, however I was determined to create a masterpiece. In three weeks, I learnt to build an electric gutair body out of old Ikea side tables, and assemble them into one of my most prized possessions. I named it ["Trikea"](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31988285/Trikea-Old-IKEA-furniture-put-to-good-use).

- Resourceful

I've also produced a [photographic book](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32004029/Transiendence), created entirely from my own work. I taught myself how to [design in 3D](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32002401/3D-Modelling-With-Blender), play guitar and [produce music](https://soundcloud.com/temka1991).

- Analytical

If there's anything I've learnt at University, it's not to go head on into over-ambitious projects and work on too many things at once. Breaking things down into steps was the way that I managed to create my final major project in Graphic design, as well as my various projects at Makers Academy.

- Team player

Throughout the Makers Academy course I worked in pairs or as a team every day. For me, communication and coordination was of the utmost importance.

- Multi-lingual

I finished the last 3 years of school in French, completed an intensive summer course in Spanish and have family and friends in Italy whom I interact with regularly.

- Troubleshooting and attention to detail

I have a good eye for spotting typos, or fragile code. For example, I helped my teammate from our last project fix his delete method and several other minor code breaking issues.

- Problem solving

I've always had a knack for fixing things including radiators, a toilet flush, shower head and even my own laptop. This passion for problem solving led me to coding, where I love to reconstruct my own code and help others adjust theirs. 

- Creative

As a child I built lego sculptures, crafted Roman armour out of cardboard and played some of the 90's most infamous video games, which eventually led me into the direction of graphic design. My creative streak isn't necessarily artistically focused, but is more driven towards functionality. I enjoy visualizing new and stimulating implementations to my creations. A key example of this would be [this diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8j1h64XKkhAdml1U0JsYWEzUE0/view?usp=sharing).

### Hobbies

Although I've decided to stop my pursuit of a career in graphic design, this hasn't stopped from experimenting. Most recently I have delved into 3D graphics. I've played guitar for 9 years, and I love to produce my own music. I am inspired by the likes of Flying Lotus and Radiohead, as well as many other artists across all genres. I also like to do DIY because I believe that if I can make something myself, then there really is no reason to buy it.
