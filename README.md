# CV
## Francesco Nunez Alessi

Born in Rome, I grew up in the UK before heading to Belgium where I finished school. Unsure of what I wanted to do, I decided to return back to the UK to study Graphic Design. After graduating, I began my career as a freelancer working for various clients on websites, logos and brochures. 

After working a lot with websites I realised the value of coding and how it could advance my career, which is how I went on to doing full-time 3 month intensive web development course at Makers Academy and loved every minute of it. At first I didn't know anything about coding except that it existed.

Now I've made about 5 different web applications including a comic-strip builder and a social hub for developers on GitHub.

With my new found love of coding, I am now looking for a job as a junior developer.

### Skills

- Focused

I had no experience with wood work and building instruments, however I was determined to make my own guitar body and assemble my dream guitar. In three weeks, I created an electric gutair body out of old Ikea side tables, and assemble them into one of my most prized possessions. I named it ["Trikea"](http://fna.design/trikea).

- Resourceful

I've also produced a [photographic book](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32004029/Transiendence), created entirely from my own work. I also taught myself how to [design in 3D](https://www.behance.net/gallery/32002401/3D-Modelling-With-Blender), play guitar and [produce music](https://soundcloud.com/temka1991).

- Analytical

If there's anything I've learnt at University, it's not to go head on into over-ambitious projects and work on too many things at once. Breaking things down into steps was the way that I managed to create my final major project in Graphic design, as well as my various projects at Makers Academy.

- Team player

Throughout the Makers Academy course I worked in pairs or as a team every day which I really enjoyed. For me, communication and coordination was of the utmost importance.

- Multi-lingual

I finished the last 3 years of school in French, completed an intensive summer course in Spanish and have family and friends in Italy with whom I interact with regularly.

- Troubleshooting and attention to detail

I have a good eye for spotting typos, or fragile code. For example, I helped my teammate from our last project fix his delete method and several other minor code breaking issues.

- Problem solving

I've always had a knack for fixing things including radiators, a toilet flush, shower head and even my own laptop. This passion for problem solving led me to coding, where I love to reconstruct my own code and help others adjust theirs.

- Creative

As a child I built lego sculptures, crafted Roman armour out of cardboard and played some of the 90's most infamous video games, which eventually led me into the direction of graphic design. My creative streak isn't necessarily artistically focused, but is more driven towards functionality. I enjoy visualizing new and stimulating implementations to my creations. A key example of this would be [this diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8j1h64XKkhAdml1U0JsYWEzUE0/view?usp=sharing).

### Hobbies

Most recently I have delved into 3D graphics. I've played guitar for 9 years, and I love to produce my own music. I made my own electric guitar body and created a custom setup. I recently purchased a Rasberry Pi and would eventually like to meddle with some robotics.
